# Legal Deposit helper
Introducing functionality for handling Legal Deposits using standard Claims and Orders

# For developers
Current node version: v16.19.0

## To update the app:
1. Update the node version (to the latest version that can work with the eca)
2. Install Exlibris' CLI in the node package: `npm install -g @exlibris/exl-cloudapp-cli`
3. Sometimes it is better to delete `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` before the next step.
4. Run: `npm install`
5. Update cloudapp-sdk: `eca update`
